# MotorManager

<p>The MotorManager library defines a common interface to accessing and managing motors and motor encoders. Implementations can then
  be written for specific motor controller boards. Currently there is an implementation of for the
  [Pololu Qik 2s9V1 motor controller](https://www.pololu.com/product/1110). More will be added as implemented. If you have a motor
  controller board implementation you would like to contribute, please feel free.</p>
