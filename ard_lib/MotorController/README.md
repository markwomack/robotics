# MotorController
<p>The MotorController library provides functionality to control motors using PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) controllers
to make sure the motors are providing the speed desired. Set the desired speed and the controllers will do the rest. You do not
set the speed of the motors, the PID controllers will manage it. A MotorManager interface is used by MotorController to access the
motors.</p>
