# Robot Mark II 'Beatrice' Test Sketches

These sketches can be used to "bring up" the various components of the robot
in isolation of the other components. You can test a component in isolation
to make sure it is functioning correctly. The pin assignments should be similar
or exactly like the assignments on the final robot. Double check to make sure.
