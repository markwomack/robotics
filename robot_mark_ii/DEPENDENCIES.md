# Dependencies

<p>Besides all of the dependicies outlined elsewhere, Beatrice uses the [Teensy 3.5 microcontroller](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy35.html).
This means that you will need to install the TeensyDuino to your Arduino IDE in order for this code to compile correctly. Instruction on how
to install TeensyDuino can be [found here](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html).</p>
