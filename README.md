# robotics
The project stores the various designs, documentation, and code for my robots.

## ard_lib
This directory contains Arduino libraries that I have written and that I use in my robotics sketches. You can copy the directories in this folder to the Arduino "Libraries" directory and restart the Arduino IDE. Please see the [DEPENDENCIES](https://github.com/markwomack/robotics/blob/main/DEPENDENCIES.md) file for other Arduino library dependencies.

## robot_mark_ii
This directory contains all the Arduino sketches that I have written for my "Robot Mark II", the second robot iteration that I have built. The codename for this robot is "Beatrice". There are many test sketches to test the connections and functionality of the various sensors and motors. The "base_sketch" is the main sketch that has the behaviors I have written to run useful things on the robot.
